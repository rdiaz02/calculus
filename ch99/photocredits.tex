Except as specifically noted below or in a parenthetical credit in the
caption of a figure, all the illustrations in this book are
under my own copyright, and are copyleft licensed under the same license
as the rest of the book. 

In some cases it's clear from the date that the
figure is public domain, but I don't know the name of the artist or photographer; I would
be grateful to anyone who could help me to give proper credit.
I have assumed that images
that come from U.S. government web pages are copyright-free, since products
of federal agencies fall into the public domain.
I've included some
public-domain paintings; photographic reproductions of them are not
copyrightable in the U.S. (Bridgeman Art Library, Ltd. v. Corel Corp.,
36 F. Supp. 2d 191, S.D.N.Y. 1999).
