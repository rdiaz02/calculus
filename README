producing pdf output
=================================================================
Compiling the book into pdf format is fairly easy on a Linux
machine. Basically you just need to install some open-source
software. The following are the relevant packages on a Debian-based
system such as Ubuntu:
  texlive-full
  gnuplot
  qpdf
  m4
  inkscape
  imagemagick
  libjson-ruby
  libjson-perl (version 2.0 or higher)
  ruby 1.9.2 or higher

Go to the main directory (the one where you found this README).

Do
  make setup
This will check that you have at least inkscape 0.47 and ruby 1.9 and set all
the scripts to be executable.

Then:
  make figures
  make book

I haven't tried compiling the books on MacOS X or Windows. I suspect
it could be done on MacOS X without any heroic measures, and I suspect
that it would be a real pain on Windows.
